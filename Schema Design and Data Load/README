We provide you with a fairly large volume of data downloaded (over a decade ago!) from the eBay web site and stored
in JSON files. JSON is a model primarily used to store semi-structured data. It has become increasing popular in
recent years, and, for now, you can treat it as just another type of data that is very straightforward to read.
You will examine the data and design a good relational schema for it. You will then write a Python program to
transform the data from its JSON form into SQLiteâ€™s load file format, conforming to your relational schema. You will
create your schema in a SQLite database, load your transformed data, and test it by running some SQL queries over it.
